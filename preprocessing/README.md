This directory contains all of the preprocessing codes for the datasets (mostly as described in the section 'Final sample processing' in the thesis)

the reconstruction folder is deprecated
the 4 seq experiments folder is deprecated
In general, the preprocessing could be done a lot nicer -- everything could be refactored such that the complete code
is in 1 or 2 files; currently it's more like 1 file per preprocessing variant

Tissue codes / types:  
Ventricle heart => heart  
Brain Cortex => brain_cortex  
Cerebellum => cerebellum
