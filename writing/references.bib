	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

	abstract = {To facilitate precision medicine and neuroscience research, we developed a machine-learning technique that scores the likelihood that a gene, when mutated, will cause a neurological phenotype. We analysed 1126 genes relating to 25 subtypes of Mendelian neurological disease defined by Genomics England (March 2017) together with 154 gene-specific features capturing genetic variation, gene structure and tissue-specific expression and co-expression. We randomly re-sampled genes with no known disease association to develop bootstrapped decision-tree models, which were integrated to generate a decision tree-based ensemble for each disease subtype. Genes generating larger numbers of distinct transcripts and with higher probability of having missense mutations in normal individuals were significantly more likely to cause neurological diseases. Using mouse-mutant phenotypic data we tested the accuracy of gene-phenotype predictions and found that for 88\% of all disease subtypes there was a significant enrichment of relevant phenotypic abnormalities when predicted genes were mutated in mice and in many cases mutations produced specific and matching phenotypes. Furthermore, using only newly identified genes included in the Genomics England November 2017 release, we assessed our gene-phenotype predictions and showed an 8.3 fold enrichment relative to chance for correct predictions. Thus, we demonstrate both the explanatory and predictive power of machine-learning-based models in neurological disease.},

	abstract = "{GC content bias describes the dependence between fragment count (read coverage) and GC content found in Illumina sequencing data. This bias can dominate the signal of interest for analyses that focus on measuring fragment abundance within a genome, such as copy number estimation (DNA-seq). The bias is not consistent between samples; and there is no consensus as to the best methods to remove it in a single sample. We analyze regularities in the GC bias patterns, and find a compact description for this unimodal curve family. It is the GC content of the full DNA fragment, not only the sequenced read, that most influences fragment count. This GC effect is unimodal: both GC-rich fragments and AT-rich fragments are underrepresented in the sequencing results. This empirical evidence strengthens the hypothesis that PCR is the most important cause of the GC bias. We propose a model that produces predictions at the base pair level, allowing strand-specific GC-effect correction regardless of the downstream smoothing or binning. These GC modeling considerations can inform other high-throughput sequencing analyses such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq.}",

	abstract = {The exon/intron architecture of genes determines whether components of the spliceosome recognize splice sites across the intron or across the exon. Using in vitro splicing assays, we demonstrate that splice-site recognition across introns ceases when intron size is between 200 and 250 nucleotides. Beyond this threshold, splice sites are recognized across the exon. Splice-site recognition across the intron is significantly more efficient than splice-site recognition across the exon, resulting in enhanced inclusion of exons with weak splice sites. Thus, intron size can profoundly influence the likelihood that an exon is constitutively or alternatively spliced. An EST-based alternative-splicing database was used to determine whether the exon/intron architecture influences the probability of alternative splicing in the Drosophila and human genomes. Drosophila exons flanked by long introns display an up to 90-fold-higher probability of being alternatively spliced compared with exons flanked by two short introns, demonstrating that the exon/intron architecture in Drosophila is a major determinant in governing the frequency of alternative splicing. Exon skipping is also more likely to occur when exons are flanked by long introns in the human genome. Interestingly, experimental and computational analyses show that the length of the upstream intron is more influential in inducing alternative splicing than is the length of the downstream intron. We conclude that the size and location of the flanking introns control the mechanism of splice-site recognition and influence the frequency and the type of alternative splicing that a pre-mRNA transcript undergoes.},

Methods adopted for each step of EST analysis by various research groups have been compared. Challenges that lie ahead in organizing and analysing the ever increasing EST data have also been identified.The most appropriate software tools for EST pre-processing, clustering and assembly, database matching and functional annotation have been compiled (available online from http://biolinfo.org/EST).

In recent years, this area has been dominated by convolutional neural networks, which typically outperform previously designed methods as a result of automated scanning for influential sequence motifs. However, those architectures do not allow for the efficient processing of the full genomic sequence. As an improvement, we introduce transformer architectures for whole genome sequence labeling tasks. We show that these architectures, recently introduced for natural language processing, allow for a fast processing of long DNA sequences. We apply existing networks and introduce an optimized method for the calculation of attention from input nucleotides. To demonstrate this, we evaluate our architecture on several sequence labeling tasks, and find it to achieve state-of-the-art performances when comparing it to specialized models for the annotation of transcription start sites, translation initiation sites and 4mC methylation in E. coli, substantiating the robustness of the newly introduced framework.},

	abstract = {Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and cells derived from them, have become key tools to model biological processes and disease mechanisms, particularly in cell types such as neurons that are difficult to access from living donors. Here, we present the first map of regulatory variants in an iPSC-derived cell type. To investigate genetic contributions to human sensory function, we performed 123 differentiations of iPSCs from 103 unique donors to a sensory neuronal fate, and measured gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and neuronal excitability. Compared with primary dorsal root ganglion, where sensory nerves collect near the spinal cord, gene expression was more variable across iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, particularly in genes related to differentiation and nervous system development. Single cell RNA-sequencing revealed that although the majority of cells are neuronal and express the expected marker genes, a substantial fraction have a fibroblast-like expression profile. By applying an allele-specific method we identify 3,778 quantitative trait loci influencing gene expression, 6,318 for chromatin accessibility, and 2,097 for RNA splicing at FDR 10\%. A number of these overlap with common disease associations, and suggest candidate causal variants and target genes. These include known causal variants at SNCA for Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease and TNFRSF1A for multiple sclerosis, as well as new candidates for migraine, Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease, and schizophrenia.},

	abstract = "{ Ultra-deep RNA sequencing has become a powerful approach for genome-wide analysis of pre-mRNA alternative splicing. We develop MATS (multivariate analysis of transcript splicing), a Bayesian statistical framework for flexible hypothesis testing of differential alternative splicing patterns on RNA-Seq data. MATS uses a multivariate uniform prior to model the between-sample correlation in exon splicing patterns, and a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method coupled with a simulation-based adaptive sampling procedure to calculate the P -value and false discovery rate (FDR) of differential alternative splicing. Importantly, the MATS approach is applicable to almost any type of null hypotheses of interest, providing the flexibility to identify differential alternative splicing events that match a given user-defined pattern. We evaluated the performance of MATS using simulated and real RNA-Seq data sets. In the RNA-Seq analysis of alternative splicing events regulated by the epithelial-specific splicing factor ESRP1, we obtained a high RTâ€“PCR validation rate of 86\% for differential exon skipping events with a MATS FDR of. Additionally, over the full list of RTâ€“PCR tested exons, the MATS FDR estimates matched well with the experimental validation rate. Our results demonstrate that MATS is an effective and flexible approach for detecting differential alternative splicing from RNA-Seq data. }",

The mRNA sequences in this fraction were mapped between 51.7 and 61.3 units on the genome by visualizing RNA.DNA hybrids in the electron microscope. When hybrids of hexon mRNA and single-stranded restriction endonuclease cleavage fragments of viral DNA were visualized in the electron microscope, branched forms were observed in which 160 nucleotides of RNA from the 5' terminus were not hydrogen bonded to the single-stranded DNA. DNA sequences complementary to the RNA sequences in each 5' tail were found by electron microscopy to be located at 17, 20, and 27 units on the same strand as that coding for the body of the hexon mRNA. Thus, four segments of viral RNA may be joined together during the synthesis of mature hexon mRNA. A model is presented for adenovirus late mRNA synthesis that involves multiple splicing during maturation of a larger precursor nuclear RNA.},
