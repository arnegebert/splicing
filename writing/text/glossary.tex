%To keep this glossary useful, we mainly focus on abbreviations specific to our domain and don't list very common abbrevations (such as NLP - Natural Language Processing).
\begin{mclistof}{Glossary}{3.2cm}
%\item[NLP] Natural Language Processing
%\item[CV] Computer Vision
\item[Splicing] Process by which a pre-mRNA is converted to a mature mRNA or the actual act of cutting out genomic sequences in that process itself.
\item[Exon] Genomic sequence which is typically kept from the pre-mRNA during splicing.
\item[Intron] Genomic sequence which is typically removed from the pre-mRNA during splicing.
 \item[Junction] Site in a mature mRNA transcript where two exons border each other.
\item[PSI] Percent-spliced in, in what proportions of transcript a specific exon (or junction) is contained in the mature mRNA.
\item[Motif] A widespread nucleotide sequence pattern conjectured to be biologically significant.
%\item[MLP] Multi-layer perceptron
