\chapter{\label{ch:1-intro}Introduction} 




In summary, we make the following contributions:


The rest of the text is organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Chapter 2 succinctly introduces the required biological background to enable the reader to follow the rest of this work. It also gives more detail about the importance of splicing.
	\item Chapter 3 reviews the splicing codes which have already been developed.
	\item Chapter 4 describes the dataset construction and the evaluated models in detail. It is by far the longest and most theoretical chapter due to us developing datasets and due to us modifying the Attention mechanism known from Transformer models.
	\item Chapter 5 presents the results of evaluating the models on a total of 16 different datasets. This includes the dataset whom we show to be critically confounded and the datasets for whose future us we advocate.
	\item Chapter 6 summarizes our findings and draws more general conclusions. We also give suggestions for future work.
\end{itemize}
